`learn_rust.md` was generated by `Claude Sonnet 3.7` with the following prompt...

```
Can you look through all the projects, through the source (*.rs) and config (*.toml) and create `learn_rust.md` so that I can print this out and review this, like a book.
```

vscode has an extension called `Markdown PDF` which is useful for printable markdown format but it didn't seem manage this larger file.

What worked was:
> pandoc -f markdown -t html learn_rust.md -o learn_rust.html
Then print to PDF (or to printer).
